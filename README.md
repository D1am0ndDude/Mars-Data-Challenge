# Mars-Data-Challenge

We learned to scrape information from the Mars Website:https://data-class-mars-challenge.s3.amazonaws.com/Mars/index.html Using BeautifulSoup, Splinter, and Pandas to extract specific information that we wanted. 

# Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles. We ran a query to extract all of the IDs with News, and Class with Containers. To find out what to extract, we inspected the website, and located what part of the <body> to use. 

# Deliverable 2: Scraped and analyzed Mars weather data. Doing so allowed us to answer several questions.  

* There are 12 Months on Mars
* There are 1867 Martian days worth of data.
* The lowest minimum average temperature is -83.30729166666667. It occurs in month 3
* The highest minimum average temperature is -68.38297872340425. It occurs in month 8
* The lowest average pressure is 745.0544217687075. It occurs in month 6
* The highest average pressure is 913.3059701492538. It occurs in month 9

# Summary
As we can see by what we researched. Mars is very different from Earth. The temperatures are extremly cold. Exploring the planet without protective suits will be impossible. Also, the pressure. Those are also extremes that no man could survive in.
